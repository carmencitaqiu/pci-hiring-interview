    TODO {10}: (OPTIONAL) If you still have time, apply classes 
    to all html elements, create containers if necessary, 
    and then apply styles so the page looks nicer, just a bit 
    nicer i don't need any wasted effort here. You can also 
    modify global styles and create scss variables if needed.
